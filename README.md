# JPACRUDProject

# Description

This project is a database of animeshows I have watched (and counting). It displays two columns with the columns being the shows ID in the database and the shows title. You can click on the title to read the description about the show, or update/delete if you the use so chooses. The user can also look up a show based off of ID. The top navagation bar will drop down to give a user the option to add a show to the list. Once a user submit a show, the newly created show will automatically display on the bottom of the list.

# Lessons Learned
I learned an important lesson about refactoring project names - be careful when doing so. I made this mistake and it caused a lot of errors. This experience helped me gain a better understanding of backend development and structuring a basic website and database. I had to learn how to make connections between where data was being passed to and from due to syntax mistakes or typos. Once I figured out what parameter names needed to match other parameters, I was able to see the process as a whole.

The most enjoyable part of this project was creating the database itself using MySQL. It was fascinating to learn how to create and manage database table. It was challenging at first, as MySQL seemed to keep randomly deleting my data. 

I still need to improve my knowledge and skills on CSS as I feel I hardly have time to get to that point to that point of the project.
